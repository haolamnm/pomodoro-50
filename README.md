## Overview

Pomodoro 50 is a Flask web app I built as a final project for **CS50x 2024**. The app uses the 50-minute Pomodoro session, but you can adjust it. It also includes Gemini AI that gives a little motivational push if you pause for questionable reasons. Itâ€™s a small experiment in combining habit-building with light AI interaction.
